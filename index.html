                    <p>I am deeply committed to humanitarian causes and believe that everyone deserves basic necessities like shelter and food. My journey in community service began in grade 5 when I was elected President of the Child Club in my village. This early experience gave me the opportunity to engage with my community and fostered a lifelong passion for helping others. Despite my young age, I led initiatives such as street cleaning campaigns and cultural programs.</p>
                    <p>Throughout my life, I have been involved in various volunteer activities. I organized blood donation drives and provided aid to those affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. During my undergraduate studies, I created a database of blood donors, which significantly streamlined the process of finding matching donors in urgent situations.</p>
                    <p>In the United States, I have continued my volunteer efforts with organizations such as Greater Indy Habitat for Humanity, where I assisted in constructing two houses for low-income families in Speedway, Indiana. Currently, I volunteer at the Food Pantry of Saint Vincent de Paul in Noblesville, where I help stock and distribute groceries to over 150 families in Hamilton County each week.</p>
