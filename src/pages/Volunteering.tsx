        From age 13, I served as the Child Club leader in my village community. That experience taught me to listen first, take responsibility, and follow through. Over time, this grew into a steady habit of giving back. Today, I do regular community work with local organizations and nonprofits, helping with events, logistics, food drives, and outreach. I try to stay respectful, dependable, and low-profile, focusing on what is needed rather than drawing attention to myself.
